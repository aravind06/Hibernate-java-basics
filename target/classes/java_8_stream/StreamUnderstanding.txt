stream:
	Stream -> Intermediate operation(IO 1) -> IO 2 -> IO N -> Terminal operation.
	
    Short-circuited: 
		- It knows subsequent intermediate operatios and based on that previous are run 
		- e.x. limit(5)
	loop fusion:
		- This joining together of operations in a single pass is an optimization technique

Intermediate operations:
	filter()
	map()
	flatMap()
	distinct()
	sorted()
	peek()
	limit()
	skip()
	
Terminal operations:
 	forEach()
	forEachOrdered()
	toArray()
	reduce()
	collect()
	min()
	max()
	count()
	anyMatch()
	allMatch()
	noneMatch()
	findFirst()  
	findAny()
